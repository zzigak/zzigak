## About me
**Personal website:** https://zzigak.github.io/

**Research Interests.** I'm broadly interested in the intersection of physical simulation, machine learning, and computer graphics. Currently I'm focusing on code generation for physical simulation and world modelling. Previously I dabbled in physically plausible re-simulations.
