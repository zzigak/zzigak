## About me
I currently pursing my B.A. in Mathematics and CS, through the College Scholars program at Cornell University. At Cornell I'm fortunate to work with Kevin Ellis. I previously worked with Abe Davis on time-lapse generation and modal analysis for resimulation. 

**Research Interests.** I'm broadly interested in the intersection of physical simulation, machine learning, and computer graphics. Currently I'm focusing on refactoring and code generation for physical simulation. Previously I dabbled in physically plausible re-simulations. 

Please visit my website for more information about my research and projects https://zzigak.github.io.
